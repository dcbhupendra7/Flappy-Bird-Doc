# Genetic Algorithms - Nature’s Trick

A _Genetic Algorithm_ is like how animals evolve in nature, but for our game birds! Here’s how it works:

1. **Start with a Team**: We begin with 50 birds, each with random flying skills.
2. **Test Them**: They try to fly through the pipes. Most crash, but a few do better.
3. **Pick the Best**: The top birds (like the top 10) are the "winners" because they flew farther.
4. **Make New Birds**: We mix the winners’ skills (like parents and kids) and add small random changes (mutations).
5. **Repeat**: This makes a new "generation." Over time, they get better!

**Game Connection**: When "Birds Alive" hits 0, a new generation starts. The "Generation" number goes up, and the birds crash less!
