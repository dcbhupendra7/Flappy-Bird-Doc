# Neural Networks - The Bird Brains

A _Neural Network_ is like a tiny brain inside each bird. It helps them decide when to flap:

1. **Inputs**: The bird "sees":
   - How far the next pipe is.
   - The height of the pipe’s gap.
   - Where the bird is flying right now.
2. **Thinking**: The neural network mixes these clues with numbers to guess: "Should I flap?"
3. **Output**: It says "Flap!" or "Don’t flap!" and the bird listens.

**Game Connection**: At first, the guesses are random, so birds crash. But the genetic algorithm keeps the best guessers, so later birds flap smarter!
