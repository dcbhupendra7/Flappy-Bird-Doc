# How They Work Together

The genetic algorithm and neural network team up like this:

- The _neural network_ is the birdâ€™s brain, deciding when to flap.
- The _genetic algorithm_ is like a coach, picking the smartest birds and making new ones better.
- Over many generations, the birds learn to dodge pipes like pros!

**Game Example**: When you see "Generation: 10" and birds flying farther, their brains got better recipes from the coach!
