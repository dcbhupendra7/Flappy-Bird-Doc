Why do you think that happened?</p> <p></p> <p>This is what the game looks like in AI Mode. See the numbers at the top?

Here\u2019s how it works:</p> <ol> <li>Start with a Team: We begin with 50 birds, each with random flying skills.</li> <li>Test Them: They try to fly through the pipes. Most crash, but a few do better.</li> <li>Pick the Best: The top birds (like the top 10) are the \"winners\" because they flew farther.</li> <li>Make New Birds: We mix the winners\u2019 skills (like parents and kids) and add small random changes (mutations).</li> <li>Repeat: This makes a new \"generation.\" Over time, they get better!</li> </ol> <p>Game Connection: When \"Birds Alive\" hits 0, a new generation starts.
